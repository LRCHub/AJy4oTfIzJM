```lrc
[00:30.05] You've never wanted to know me before
[00:34.04] Little or no association
[00:37.09] Leave me alone, I want to live
[00:40.04] Stop sucking the blood right out of me
[00:59.04] 
[01:11.01] Couldn't care less if I died right now
[01:16.09] Who am I?
[01:18.05] I don't know, you tell me
[01:21.02] You seem to know everything else
[01:37.02] 
[01:38.02] Need a pathway need a guide
[01:42.04] Contemplating suicide
[01:45.08] Wish I could be like you
[01:48.04] You say you care, but do you
[01:57.08] Do you
[02:03.04] Do you
[02:06.04] 
[02:58.04] What if I
[03:01.09] I can't move around?
[03:04.09] What if I
[03:07.05] I can't move around?
[03:17.05] 
[03:30.04] Burn
